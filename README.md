# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression


## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project implements **Heart Disease Prediction** using **Logistic Regression from scratch**.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, and a **Flask web application** for predictions.


## ðŸš€ Features  
- Predict heart disease using Logistic Regression  
- Implemented from scratch without using sklearn's model  
- Flask web app for user interaction  
- Dataset preprocessing and model evaluation included  


## ðŸ“Š Model Training  
- The logistic regression model is implemented in `Logistics Regression Scratch Implementation.py`.  
- The trained model is saved as `logistic_regression_model.pkl`.  
- To retrain the model, run:  
  ```sh
  python FinalProgram.py
